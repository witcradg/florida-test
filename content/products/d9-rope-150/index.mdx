###Precautions

USE RESPONSIBLY. DO NOT DRIVE OR OPERATE ANY MACHINERY WHILE USING THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN THE AMOUNT RECOMMENDED BY YOUR DOCTOR.

Consult a physician before using this product. 

Do not use if pregnant, nursing, or if you have any diagnosed or undiagnosed health conditions.

Must be 21 years or older to purchase or use.

This Delta 8 THC may affect blood pressure, heart rate, and/or intraocular pressure in some people. If you have any known or unknown heart, blood pressure, eye, eye pressure, or similar/related issues, do not use this product unless recommended by a doctor.

###Heat Issues

Delta 8 gummies don’t always do well in hot climates. If your delta 8 gummies have melted into a (delicious) singular gummy blob, a quick remedy is to place them in the freezer for up to 1 hour. Once frozen, open the bag at the sides and cut into equal pieces. Precise dosing requires a gram scale.

Take gummies with food or eat within 10-30 minutes after taking them for best effects.

###Smell When Opening the Bag

Don’t worry, your products are fine! This is due to the oxygen pack doing its thing within the bag. Your gummies shouldn’t absorb any of that flavor, just let the bag sit open for a bit and it’ll go away soon enough. You can remove the oxygen pack as well if you’d like.
